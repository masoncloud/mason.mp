The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) is a United States federal law, enacted in 2004, that allows two classes of persons - the "QUALIFIED DoD (ACTIVE) Law Enforcement Officer" and the "QUALIFIED DoD (RETIRED or SEPARATED) Law Enforcement Officer" - to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States or United States Territories, regardless of state or local laws.

## H.R.1210 - LEOSA Reform Act

WASHINGTON, D.C.— Today, Rep. Don Bacon (NE-02-R) was joined by Reps. Henry Cuellar (TX-28-D), John Rutherford (FL-04-R), and Pete Stauber (MN-08-R) in introducing H.R. 1210: Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) Reform Act. 

The LEOSA Reform Act is a critical piece of legislation that will improve public safety by allowing qualified law enforcement officers who have committed themselves to our communities, the opportunity to continue doing so by extending their concealed carry privileges. This legislation expands the LEOSA exemption to allow qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry firearms on state, local, and private property otherwise open to the public; in national parks; of magazines not prohibited by federal law; and in Federal security level I or II public access facilities. This legislation also allows for these qualified professionals to carry on Gun Free School Zones and reforms qualification standards to alleviate undue burdens which currently exist. 

“Current and retired law enforcement officers have put their lives on the line for our communities and are many times called upon to do so even when they are not wearing their uniform,” said Rep. Bacon. “Unfortunately, our officers are facing greater and greater dangers, and current restrictions hinder their ability to carry firearms. This legislation allows them the freedom to carry in a capacity that is not only safe and best for them, but also for the community, as long as they maintain proper training and certification.” 

“Many of our retired law enforcement officers are ready to continue serving our community but are unable to due to current law,” said Rep. Cuellar. “This bipartisan legislation will fix the issues that our nation’s off-duty officers and retired cops face while concealed carrying. I remain steadfast in my support for the men and woman who put their lives on the line every day to protect our homes, neighborhoods, businesses and communities.”

“Retired law enforcement officers who meet stringent training standards should be able to maintain an enhanced concealed carry license across state lines,” said Rep. Rutherford. “As a former sheriff and lifelong police officer, I know how important it is to allow retired officers to continue protecting our communities. Thank you to Congressman Bacon for his hard work on this bill and for his commitment to our retired law enforcement officers.”

“As a former law enforcement officer, I know that our officers swear an oath to protect and serve their communities,” said Rep. Stauber. “That commitment does not stop at the end of a shift, or at the end of a career. There is no one more qualified to safeguard our communities than the men and women in law enforcement, so I am proud to cosponsor legislation that will protect and extend current and retired officers’ concealed carry privileges.”

The LEOSA Reform Act has been endorsed by 25 professional law enforcement organizations. <br>
